;THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO RUN JOBS WHEN DR AKKERMAN'S PROCESSORS ARE BEING USED
;I USUALLY REQUEST THE PROCESSORS ON THE STANDBY QUEUE

1. runjob.PBS is the PBS script, adapt to this to run your desired job.
2. mycron is the auto-execution file to run the shell script (myscript.sh) each 5-10-15 min, etc... (read more about this on the internet). 
3. input_gen.py is the python file,, it basically modifies some strings in input.in
4. input.in is the journal file (FLUENT uses this to execute instructions)
5. myscript.sh is gonna execute runjob.PBS based on a condition.
